      "When I joined the 470,000 other women who walked down Constitution Avenue toward the National Mall on Jan. 21, the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration, I carried a sign saying, “Don’t Forget, White Women Voted for Trump.”  \n",
      "My message stood in stark contrast to the theme of togetherness that dominated the Women’s March — the pink “pussy hats” and “girl power” placards, and chants about how women would lead the resistance. This was exactly the point. I made the sign to communicate that in a world where 53 percent of white women voters chose a racist, elitist sexual predator for president, the idea that we all want the same thing is a myth.  \n",
      "The point wasn’t to antagonize the Women’s March participants, who were mostly white. Rather, I wanted to highlight that on a national level, white women are not unified in opposition to Trumpism and can’t be counted on to fight it. Instead, it’s the identity, experience and leadership of black women that we must look to.  \n",
      "Democrats want to position themselves as a pro-woman, pro-immigrant, pro-equality party. We do ourselves a disservice if we believe the myth that a majority of white women voting in the era of Trump are moved by that message. The numbers don’t lie: For many white women, it’s racial identity, not gender or party, that guides their choices in the voting booth. As my sign pointed out, in 2016 more than half of white female voters chose Mr. Trump. A year later, in Virginia, 51 percent of white women voted for the Republican Ed Gillespie, who lost after running an anti-immigrant, white-nationalist-sympathizing, Steve Bannon-backed campaign for governor.  \n",
      "Last week, by late Tuesday evening, we learned that two-thirds of white female voters in Alabama had once again voted for the Trump agenda, casting ballots for Roy Moore, a man accused of sexually assaulting teenagers and one with a dismal record on civil rights who was on tape saying the country was last “great” during slavery.  \n",
      "Despite this, the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, was able to score an unlikely victory thanks to the historic turnout of black voters — specifically, black women. A full 98 percent cast ballots for Mr. Jones. Ninety-eight percent.  \n",
      "If I had to make another sign after the Alabama election, it would say this: “Bet on black women. Follow black women. Give power to black women.” I’d wave it in front of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and every political start-up’s office, and pass out copies to all those emerging resistance groups.  \n",
      "At a time when others are clinging to or are willing to tolerate political messages rooted in white nationalism and fear, black women are the voters who’ve consistently rejected these things. We’re keenly aware that issues that affect us and our communities are always on the ballot, whether it’s access to lifesaving health care, the fight to save public schools, or the imminent threat of police violence and harassment. We know we don’t have the option to sit out elections.  \n",
      "It’s our insight here that Democrats should look to. The issues about which we’re informed and passionate affect Americans of all races and genders, even if others may not use their votes as wisely as we do.  \n",
      "We don’t just vote; we lead as well by mobilizing our communities to vote. In Alabama, leaders like Lenice C. Emanuel of the Alabama Institute for Social Justice and Felecia Lucky of the Black Belt Community Foundation spent years building the infrastructure that led to Tuesday night’s victory. In Virginia, projects like In Charge: Black Women Taking Action tapped into the turnout power of black women to engage over 300 black female volunteers and contact nearly 5,000 voters in the final three weeks before Election Day.  \n",
      "BlackPAC, led by Adrianne Shropshire, was on the ground before the elections in Virginia and in Alabama, with an army of canvassers. Other groups led by black women, like the Movement for Black Lives Electoral Project, Woke Vote and Southerners on New Ground, do this work across the country and need support.  \n",
      "Instead of taking this political talent, enthusiasm and energy for granted — and instead of wasting energy on white voters who don’t share its values — the Democratic Party should invest in amplifying black women’s proven dedication to the party. As a first step, perhaps some would-be candidates who think of themselves as “next in line” should step aside and make space for more black women like Tishaura Jones in St. Louis and Stacey Abrams in Georgia.  \n",
      "Black women are being widely credited for saving the day in Alabama, and that credit is one small step in the right direction. But we don’t need thanks — we need you to get out of the way and follow our lead.  \n"

      "WASHINGTON — We finally got close enough to the Smithsonian Castle to stand in the crowd — or, in my 9-year-old daughter Phoebe’s case, perch on a ledge  — to hear the speakers, and glimpse, if we craned our necks, an edge of the giant screen. We raised our fists in solidarity for abortion rights. We called out in agreement at the speaker who said that every mother trying to get a good job knows that the economy is a woman’s issue, and every mother trying to keep her family together knows that immigration is a woman’s issue. We chanted with poets. We wiped away tears at 6-year-old Sophie Cruz, daughter of two undocumented immigrants, who brought down the house when she said: “I also want to tell the children not to be afraid, because we are not alone.” \n",
      "We ate granola bars and nibbled raw almonds and we pledged to go back home and keep working.\n",
      "Then word started to filter out that the march component of the march might not happen exactly as planned — too many people. My 9-year-old had had it. It was time to go.\n",
      "A helpful official at the Smithsonian metro station asked where we were headed, and gave us options for getting to the red line. “If we wanted to walk, how would we do that?” I asked.\n",

      "Soon my daughter and I will head back to Philadelphia, back to a world where we’re not surrounded by like-minded ladies in pink hats. We live in a big, diverse city — hardly the burning, drug and crime-ridden hell-hole that President Trump imagines, but definitely a place where there is poverty. And racism. And homophobes. And doctors who despise Obamacare, and women who hate Hillary Clinton, and disgruntled white guys who look at a world in which they no longer feel at home and voted for the man who pledged to put them back on top.\n",

      "As protesters flooded past the Trump Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, they booed, hissed, and made obscene gestures. One hand-drawn sign depicted Mr. Trump as Jabba the Hutt, the classic Star Wars villain, with Princess Leia standing triumphantly on top of him, choking him with a chain.\n",
      "Two young women stood outside the hotel in matching red “woman power” beanies and red lipstick.\n",
      "“This is the first time I’ve truly been politically informed and involved,” said Jessica Martin, 24, who came down to Washington from Boston.\n",
      "“This has been such a life-changing experience for me,“ her friend, Lauren Engelke, said.\n",
      "But they didn’t have a concrete plan for how to continue their political engagement after this weekend is over. Ms. Martin said she has donated to Planned Parenthood. Ms. Engelke, who described herself as an ardent Bernie Sanders supporter, said she was interested in a forum hosted by the group EMILY’s List on how women can get involved in local politics.\n",
      "“I’m tired of sitting by,” she said.\n",
      "Mary Burleson, from Austin, Tex., said she felt it was important to take part in the protest, but admitted she’s “not really involved in anything” in her home state. She recognized the need to keep political pressure on the Trump administration in the years ahead.\n",
      "“We can’t go home and go back to business as usual, because it’s serious,” she said.\n",
      "Linda Dougall traveled to Washington from Oakland, Calif. and wore a Black Lives Matter pin, which was not a common accessory among many of her white, middle-aged contemporaries at the march. She said she hasn’t thought deeply about what steps come next, but that her home state isn’t exactly Trump country.\n",
      "“I’m not really getting emails about what the next steps are,” she said. “In California, because it’s so liberal, we’re all pretty much against him.”\n",
      "The crowd at the Women’s March on Saturday was overwhelmingly female, and also overwhelmingly white. Some marchers were thinking about intersectional feminism — meaning, being inclusive of people from all walks of life and the different levels of privilege afforded to different segments of society. Some were struggling with the knowledge that, because the majority of white female voters in the United States went for Donald J. Trump, not Hillary Clinton, they might be part of the problem.\n",
      "Erica Dixon, a science writer in Washington, wore a “Nasty Woman” ring and held up a sign across from the Trump Hotel reading “The future is feminist as f—.” While she voted for Hillary Clinton, she readily accepted the role white women played in this election.\n",
      "White women \"are the worst!” said Ms. Dixon. Her two white female friends nodded in agreement. \"We did this.”\n",
      "“There’s more to activism than protest, and there’s more to activism than only talking to friends who already agree with you,” she said. “We have to be uncomfortable, for as many years as it takes.”\n",

      "It’s possible — and depending on where you are geographically, it’s likely — that the polite Midwesterner with whom you’re making chitchat about the weather voted for a president who seems racist, sexist and xenophobic. This is what made marching up downtown’s Market Street, from the train station to the Arch, so thrilling today: Everywhere I turned, there were thousands and thousands and thousands of fellow progressives, and they — we — were singing and chanting and cheering because we share a belief in civil rights and democracy.\n",
      "Living in Missouri, I don’t always feel I’m among my people; this morning, in a profound way, I did. There were babies and toddlers and children and teens and adults and the elderly; there were women and men; there were different races; there were nuns and bare breasts and countless pink you-know-what hats. \n",
      "And the signs — oh the signs! The great majority were homemade and many were brightly-colored, and they said “This Is Not Normal” and “Black Lives Matter.” They said “Keep Your Tiny Hands off My Daughter’s Rights.“ They said “Nasty Nana” and “I could be asleep but you forced me to protest!” and “White People: What Will We Do To End Our Legacy of Violence?”\n",
      "My friend Beth had made a sign that said “A Woman’s Place Is In the House or Senate” and her son had added in his tiny kindergarten scrawl “Woman Shod Be Safe,” and during the march, when Beth ran into U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, the senator gamely posed with the sign, after Beth said how much her government-obsessed sons love her.\n",
      "In the weeks and days before the march, I’d repeatedly asked myself two questions:\n",
      "1) I need to drink coffee beforehand, but then where will I pee?\n",
      "2) Is it really possible that almost every woman I know is going to attend, even the ultra-WASPy ones I’d guessed were apolitical?\n",
      "I’ve now learned the answers:\n",
      "1) I held it until I got home.\n",
      "2) Yes, they did, and so did tons of men, non-WASPy women, and people I’ve never met, and it was incredibly heartening to see and to be part of. \n",

      "There’s a long history here.  When women were first fighting for the right to vote, they did it in a quiet, virtuous and slightly depressing way – collecting petitions, urging referenda, campaigning to get presidential conventions to put supportive planks in their party platforms. Then a younger generation wanted to be louder and to have more fun on their way to political emancipation. They wanted … parades. \n",
      "And when Woodrow Wilson became president in 1913, thousands of women greeted his inauguration with a march through Washington led by the charismatic and beautiful Inez Milholland, wearing a long white cape astride a white horse. Milholland, who was ahead of her time on a number of fronts, lectured to young women that fighting for the right to vote was good exercise.\n",
      "In terms of numbers, of course, that parade was nothing compared to Saturday’s. But then Woodrow Wilson never referred to his chief female political advisor as “baby.”\n",
      "Ever since Milholland, new generations of women have learned that while petitions are important, marches are the thing you remember.  “Nothing can quite replace your first love or your first march,” Gloria Steinem said, remembering the day in 1970 when she was part of an equal rights protest in Central Park that grew so large the women took to the street and filled Fifth Avenue, demanding everything from a constitutional amendment to better child care. This week, many protests  later, she was back: “I’ve never in my life seen such an outpouring.”\n",
      "There was certainly no single message to the march – except, perhaps, Donald Trump’s ability to drive women crazy. Anju Singh, another march organizer, had never been to a protest before she was confronted with Trump and his opinions on immigration. “We’re people who have never met each other, who have nothing in common except this absolute sense of this male,” she said, searching for the right word.\n",
      "There were tons of speeches, some way better than others, but they were all really beside the point, which was for everyone to be together, to send pictures to friends and family, to move forward as a group united by the conviction that there’s no permanent loss until you stop fighting.\n",

      "Exactly four Saturdays ago I was in Gwanghwamun Plaza, in Seoul, working my way through a different crowd — one monolithic in its racial and cultural homogeneity: bodies that look much like one another.  It was the ninth protest in as many weeks, each gathering hundreds of thousands strong, all calling for the immediate impeachment of President Park Geun-hye in the wake of a corruption scandal. (A direct translation of my favorite sign from that day: “You Call This A Country?”) That protest was orderly sidewalks, seas of identical waving candles, sing-alongs where everyone knew all the words, staggering harmony both literal and figurative.\n",
      "“Excuse me, I’m PRETTY!”\n",
      "It’s 10:30 a.m., the rally is well underway, and it’s her again, the woman with the free signs—only she’s out of signs now. She’s leading a group of other women instead, each one hanging onto the next. My friend and I are standing against a railing with a bunch of young Latina women, and we all laugh. Around us people are less sure, but a few risk some chuckles. “Excuse me,” she says again, pressing ahead into the crowd. “I don’t know if you heard me but excuse me, I’m PRETTY.”\n",
      "The crowd parts for her and her ducklings follow, four or five, all older and white, needing help to get through, get out. A boy, also white, tall but only 15 or 16, reaches out to touch her shoulder as she passes him, says something I can’t hear. “You can come with us,” she tells him. “We’ll get you over there, back to your folks.”\n",
      "It is a different kind of togetherness in this crowd today from what I saw in Korea. This union is not automatic, requires something more, asks something extra of our bodies, how we move them and why and when. This is a crowd that needs to talk to each other to figure itself out, to articulate its intentions in order to make progress. It’s not enough to just show up.\n",

Trump had just been sworn in and everyone was watching on their laptops or phones.\n",
      "The coffee shop is near the University of South Carolina and the area is a blue island in the middle of a red sea.

They’d catch the highlights tonight on the news.\n",
      "I’ve spent the months since the election talking to Trump supporters and that answer didn’t surprise me. In my experience, they’re hardworking people who want the world to leave them alone. They like Mr. Trump because he’s strong and they think he’ll run the country like a business and keep out of everyone’s life.\n",

I lost a $5 bet over the election results, but he refused to take my money when I showed up to fork over the cash. “This will be good.

      "WASHINGTON — As soon as I found out that there would be a march on Washington to oppose Donald Trump’s presidency and policies, I was committed to being there. No matter what, I was in. Which meant that I didn’t pay a lot of attention to the specifics.\n",
      "I missed the roiling debate about whose march — and whose feminism — this was, anyway, and who had a seat at the table, and who just needed to have a seat. This could have been a march for peevish pet owners against Donald Trump, and I would have shown up and shown my opposition to the self-aggrandizing, income tax hiding, genital grabber-in-chief.\n",
      "So it was not until last night, when I arrived at the “Yikes Ball” with my mom, her partner, and my 9-year-old, that I learned anything about the speakers scheduled for today.\n",
      "“Gloria Steinem!” Fran, my mother, announced. “Angela Davis! Michael Moore!”\n",
      "I feigned enthusiasm, while thinking that the lineup could have been nearly identical to the one I heard the last time I marched on Washington, about 25 years ago. Back then — as now — the issue was abortion rights. I was in college. I carried a “Keep Abortion Legal” sign, never imagining that life would bring me full circle, and that as a middle-aged mother of two, I’d be walking the same route, with a sign expressing the same sentiment, listening to many of the same people whose words fired my blood back in the day.\n",
      "Maybe it’s fitting. After all, isn’t President Trump himself a relic of the go-go ’80s and the tabloid-stained ’90s, a “greed is good” Gordon Gekko-ish revenant come to haunt our country with a frightening vision of ourselves at our worst? “America first,” he drones, sounding like Bane with a head cold, looking, in his baggy suit and overlong tie, like a shambling, overstuffed scarecrow built for one of those anti-abortion houses of horror and left in the rain too long. “America first.”\n",
      "And so we lock our doors, and turn our backs, and ignore those in pain and in need. We discriminate against immigrants on the basis of their religion. We look at foreigners with fear. We take away free, accessible birth control. We have found ourselves in some “Black Mirror” version of “I Love the ’80s,” only with Twitter instead of tabloids, pussy bows instead of shoulder pads and Ivanka instead of Ivana.\n",
      "When I marched as a college student, I walked behind a bedsheet banner painted in blood red with the words “We Won’t Go Back.” It meant that women would not be forced to return to the days where abortion was illegal; available if you had money and connections, and fatal if you didn’t. I never dreamed that, decades later, wrinkled and stretch-marked, I would be fighting the same fight, chanting the same chants, rallying behind the same issues, hearing the same voices raised in protest as I marched the same route.\n",
      "But, as déjà vu-ish as this all feels, it also feels necessary. We won’t go back to the days when abortion was a crime. And we won’t go back to the ’80s.\n",

      "From the moment Trump commenced his campaign for the White House, he began complimenting it. My polls! My crowds! My ratings! But lately it’s the “movement” that he can’t shut up about. At least he couldn’t during his inaugural festivities.\n",
      "He mentioned it on Thursday evening at the Lincoln Memorial. He mentioned it on Friday afternoon on the steps of the Capitol. He mentioned it on Friday night at the inaugural balls. When it comes to his movement, he can’t move on.\n",
      "And he can’t stop ratcheting up the descriptions of it. The superlatives swell; the qualifications fall away.\n",
      "At the Lincoln Memorial, he suggested that he wasn’t the one taking awed stock of what he had stirred and led; others were doing that.\n",
      "“It’s a movement like we’ve never seen anywhere in the world, they say,” he told the crowd. Which “they”? Steve Bannon? The doorman at Trump Tower? The head concierge at Mar-a-Lago? I’d like to connect these “they” with a few historians, who might fill them in on the American Revolution and the French Revolution and the road to suffrage and a whole lot else, and I’m just looking back at the last few centuries. Rewind further and you’ll find yourself drowning in movements.\n",
      "By Trump’s remarks at his inauguration, “they say” went away. Poof! Gone! No need for attribution when the movement is as indubitably sweeping and unequivocally singular as his.\n",
      "And at the first of the three inaugural balls that he and Melania attended, he declaimed: “It’s a movement like they’ve never seen anywhere at any time anywhere in the world.” For those of you keeping count, that’s a double “anywhere” atop a single “any time.” It’s a movement with a whole lot of emphasis. A movement that doth protest too much.   \n",
      "And a movement with rickety numerical backing. That’s the oddest part of all. This movement stopped short of delivering Trump the popular vote, which his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won — by nearly three million ballots. This movement delivered him the Electoral College by a measly 77,000 votes in three states.\n",
      "This movement doesn’t translate into broad, deep popular regard. He begins his presidency with the lowest approval ratings of any president in modern times.\n",
      "I say none of that to challenge his legitimacy or deny the fact that he now holds the same immense power that his predecessors in the presidency did, along with the enormous responsibility to use it wisely.\n",
      "I’m just noting that his hyperbole du jour is an especially ludicrous and solipsistic riff, and I’m wishing that he’d retire it.\n",

      "Inspired by the words of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark, Dr. King said the test of a leader is the desire to be a servant, putting the cause of the greater good above self-interest. I pray President Trump embraces “cause above self” leadership.\n",
      "God holds us accountable for the talents and gifts he gives us. There is no greater accountability than to the gift of leadership. This is why he instructs those called to lead to do so with all diligence. So let us pray that President Trump leads with diligence.\n",

But Scripture also requires leaders to fear God. Why? The writer of Psalms tells us that is the beginning of all wisdom. We need a wise leader who diligently seeks wisdom. \n",
      "Let us pray that President Trump will bend his knee and bow his head in humility before God to receive divine guidance and wisdom.\n",
      "Exodus also instructs us to select leaders of truth. We need leaders who know just from unjust and righteous from unrighteous, who know God’s truth. Let us pray that President Trump immerses himself daily in God’s word and allows truth to be his compass.\n",

      "I’m not exactly sure where I fall on the feminism spectrum, but I’m pretty certain I am one. At age 12, my mother gave me with a subscription to Ms. Magazine. In the early 1980’s, as a struggling actress, I was a client of Planned Parenthood. When my fortunes rose and I could afford private health care, I trained to escort women into the facilities and now I raise money for Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles. \n",
      "I hope I won’t offend any sisters when I divulge I won’t be wearing a pink hat, playfully designed to look like female anatomy, when I march on Saturday. I get it, Donald Trump said, “grab them by the pussy” and we’re reclaiming the word. But I’m still not wearing the hat.\n",
      "For one thing, at my age, hats tend to pull my features downward making my face look “melted,” to borrow from the late, great Carrie Fisher. I reserve the right to be both vain and a feminist. \n",
      "Speaking of melting, it’s not exactly wool hat weather. The earth set a temperature record for the third year in a row, which doesn’t exactly seem encouraging. At Barack Obama’s first inauguration it was 28 degrees in D.C. and it’s expected to be in the mid-50’s on Saturday in L.A. and D.C.  \n",
      "Also, I hate the color pink. In 2014, the Think Pink exhibition at the Boston Fine Art Museum traced how in the 1700s both men and women wore pink, and it wasn’t until the post-WWII era, when a nation of Rosie The Riveters put down their tools and put on June Cleaver’s pink apron, that girls were sentenced to pink purgatory.\n",
      "Of late, pink has taken on a decidedly different association. As Barbara Ehrenreich noted in “Bright Sided,” should you receive a diagnosis of breast cancer, you are inundated with exhortations to adopt pink as your signature color. \n",
      "My mother died three months ago of metastasized breast cancer. I inherited the pink mastectomy “comfort” pillow she was issued by members of a well-meaning breast cancer support group. She loathed that pillow, preferring the lemony THC infused candies I snuck into her hospice room.  I can’t say for sure that I’d find it any less enraging if it was a another shade, but I’ve been tempted to scrawl “My mother got breast cancer and all I got was this lousy pink pillow,” and strap it across my chest when I walk in a breast cancer research fundraiser this year.\n",
      "Of course, it’s likely that no one will notice because I am marching in Los Angeles where, as someone over the age of 50, I am virtually invisible. If I were going to wear a hat, it might be tempting to put on something that reflects my hatred for pink, is anatomically inspired – and age appropriate. But no one wants to see that in grey.\n",

      "President Trump’s extraordinary Inaugural Address was at once familiar and surprising, combining echoes from a forgotten past with notes that are entirely new.\n",
      "The echoes were to a president who was viewed with as much alarm by the official Washington of his day as Mr. Trump is by today’s Washington. In his first Inaugural Address, President Andrew Jackson told a shocked capital city that the 1828 election that brought him to office “inscribes on the list of executive duties, in characters too legible to be overlooked, the task of ‘reform.’” Today, in language that was even more blunt, Mr. Trump delivered a curse-on-both-your-houses indictment directed at the nation’s political and economic establishments.\n",
      "In advocating reform, President Trump abandoned sectarianism. From Franklin D. Roosevelt to Bernie Sanders, Democrats have blamed the nation’s ills on “millionaires and billionaires.” Meanwhile, Republicans have denounced big government.\n",
      "Mr. Trump took aim at both establishments as a single, colluding entity that, he charged, has served its own interest to the detriment of the middle class. The result has been an “American carnage” of lost industry, jobs and opportunity. In response, the new president announced that, under him, America will come first. \n",
      "“We will bring back our jobs,” he said. “We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth.”\n",
      "Add it all up and the Trump inaugural was the most Jacksonian since Jackson.\n",
      "Some of the speech’s strongest passages were devoted to American unity — in particular to transcending racial and ethnic divides that have plagued the country with renewed bitterness over the past two decades. Mr. Trump’s liberal critics should take a close look at these passages.\n",
      "As he had in the campaign, the new president spoke directly to the largely African-American and Hispanic citizens of our urban areas. He addressed inner city concerns: “Mothers and children trapped in poverty”;  “rusted-out factories”; “an education system, flush with cash, but that leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge”; “gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives.” In one especially lyrical passage, he said, “Whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.” \n",
      "He invoked a common devotion to the country (“whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the red blood of patriots”) that combined with economic, educational and public safety improvements could open a new world of opportunity for our minority communities, removing barriers to racial amity.\n",
      "It is a remarkable agenda. Not that everyone will applaud. For example, our allies overseas and much of our foreign policy community at home will fear Mr. Trump’s plans to abandon the mantle of global leadership. But as was true throughout his campaign, a close look at his language points a different way. He is not advocating abandonment of alliances and responsibilities, but, as on the domestic scene, a new era of reform. \n",
      "It is a new era of reform on behalf of ordinary citizens not defined by race or ethnicity, or gender or preference, or party or ballot cast in November, but by a sense that something has gone wrong, and that what is wrong can be fixed. It was a strong, direct, honest speech. A presidency that comes at a time of national troubles has had a promising start.\n",

      "I’ve felt a guilty alienation from the chorus of “not my president” that’s been building among the left since the supposed free election of Donald J. Trump. Not because I have any connection or loyalty to the man, but because the phrase itself is something of a Trumpism: “Not my president” was a favorite refrain of the Tea Party, a fundamental buttress of the racist delegitimization of Barack Obama, an incantation that, in retrospect, recalled some of the first stirrings of Mr. Trump’s rise to power. \n",
      "Watching the inauguration — looking over the sea (or, more accurately, the smallish pond) of white faces celebrating what they clearly believe to be a white victory, a reassertion of the natural order — all reluctance left me. Mr. Trump was shoved into office by the desperate, violent and unconstitutional machinations of a minuscule sliver of super-rich, traditionalist white Americans. \n",
      "Feeling their grip on global supremacy slipping, they’ve snatched one final, improbable chance to bleed us to death so they can buy a few more gold toilets before the biosphere collapses. Mr. Trump isn’t my president. I don’t mean it emotionally; I mean it literally. It’s not sloganeering; it’s observable truth. \n",
      "Mr. Trump has no intention of representing me, my family, the people I care about, or the majority of Americans, from the imperiled to the comfortable. It is a stretch to call him anyone’s president but his own. \n",
      "In the last days of the campaign, my husband said to me, “This election is part of the Civil War.” Today, my friend Tracy Rector, an Indigenous activist and filmmaker, wrote on Facebook, “The slave masters have taken control.” It’s not a coincidence that the proto-Trumpist Tea Party so obsessively worshiped our slave-owning Founding Fathers, or that Mr. Trump was installed by the Electoral College, a mechanism designed to disproportionately empower slave states. \n",
      "Those who believe that straight, white men have a mandate to burn the rest of us as fuel, to sell us for parts, to mow us down and climb up the pile, never truly conceded that war. They have been biding their time, and this is their last great gambit. But I live in the America that won — the America with art and empathy and a free press and fierce protest. Not my president, not now, not ever.\n",

      "BEIJING — President Donald J. Trump uttered the rallying cry familiar from his campaign to close his inauguration speech, urging citizens to help “make America great again.” But his appeal for patriotism and loyalty at home will only further sink the hearts of leaders in Beijing. \n",
      "Mr. Trump the straight-talking dealmaker, on whom they had pinned their early hopes, has increasingly been eclipsed by Mr. Trump the trade bully and nationalist, for whom the pledge “America first” may entail measures like a 45 percent tariff on goods imported from China and appointing a trade chief ready to carry out such proposals. \n",
      "The inauguration speech forms a stark contrast to President Xi Jinping’s address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, where he positioned himself as a champion of globalization. But if the power of Mr. Xi’s claim is weakened by an ideological crackdown at home and his record of flouting commercial and territorial laws abroad, President Trump may in turn see his plans checked by the domestic economic damage that could result from a trade war with China. \n",
      "Given Mr. Trump’s penchant for provocative pronouncements and unpredictable policy positions, China has good reason not to resort to immediate verbal retaliation, but to let the tension roused by his words dissipate before deciding on its course of action.\n",
      "Online reactions here to Mr. Trump’s speech have been dominated by anger and confusion. For more than a few Chinese, though, his jabs at the Washington’s power elite resonated. Yawning income inequality, loss of employment and a profound disconnect between the government and the governed are, after all, not unfamiliar stories among people here. \n",
      "In the long run, the public disaffection shared by both countries will probably play a larger role in shaping Sino-American relations than the inflammatory rhetoric of national leaders. \n",

      "Donald J. Trump’s Inaugural Address was notable for its disconnect from reality. Start with what he referred to as the “American carnage” — a dystopian nation, broken and shattered. America has problems for sure, including deep pockets of poverty and distress, but Trump’s America is not the real America.\n",
      "Then there’s the unreality of what life in America will be like during the Trump presidency. He will lead us to the promised land, a nation with no need unmet, no problem unsolved, no dream beyond our reach. He promised not just a better America, but a nearly perfect America, down to its roads and bridges. He will now be held to those promises. And on national security, President Trump, in speaking about radical Islamic terrorism, promised to “eradicate” it “completely from the face of the earth.” No, he won’t.  \n",
      "There’s also the rather fantastic claim by Trump that he will act as a unifying force in American life. President Trump spoke about solidarity, the need to heal our division, and how he would make America a place “where there is no room for prejudice.” Yet Mr. Trump has done more than anyone to create the rancor and divisions that he now promises to heal. To bind up our political wounds would require Trump to become what he is not.\n",
      "President Trump’s speech was written for his supporters rather than for the nation as a whole. It was for the most part aggressive and confrontational, nationalistic and protectionist, with a quasi-isolationist theme running throughout it. He described a world in which transactions are zero-sum. And he barely mentioned words like “liberty” and “freedom,” which for a Republican is quite unusual. \n",
      "President Trump ended his speech by saying: “The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.” That is true enough. What Donald Trump may not yet realize is that that standard now applies to him.\n",

      "An inauguration sequence, replicated regularly since 1789 and complete with an oath that mentions an obligation to relinquish office, not just to serve well, sounds other-worldly to a Russian every time it is repeated. Russian czars, Soviet general secretaries, even Russian presidents have never come or left on a schedule. The history of peaceful and predictable transitions of power is America’s awe-inspiring tradition. \n",
      "One thing my countrymen are constantly arguing over is our nation’s basic objective: Is it to be a superpower feared by its neighbors or a country focused on its domestic prosperity and well-being? These two things do not necessarily contradict each other, but at certain historical conjunctures, they may start to be perceived as mutually exclusive. This happened to the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. A similar process has been under way in the United States for a while now. \n",

      "Every president takes an oath, prescribed in Article II, to “faithfully execute” the office of president and to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.” A few minutes later he (sorry, Mrs. Clinton) delivers his Inaugural Address, and it is always interesting to see what the new chief executive says in it about the Constitution.\n",
      "In President Trump’s case, he said nothing about it. The word doesn’t even occur. But that isn’t unusual: Many modern presidents take the Constitution for granted in their inaugurals and major speeches. They fill the void with something else, some other large force or cause that holds sway over our politics or commands our allegiance. Liberal presidents often turn to history or progress, benevolent forces, as they imagine them, to which even the Constitution must submit. Conservative chief executives often emphasize the authority of tradition or “traditional American values,” which is the moraine of past progress — what’s left behind by history.\n",
      "President Trump turned to the nation itself, or to the American people, who used to be the “rulers of this nation” but whose authority has been usurped by a ruling class. He didn’t use the latter term but implied it, contrasting America’s forgotten people to the “small group in our nation’s capital” who are running the show and prospering. Mr. Trump’s victory means the overthrow of this “establishment,” he said, and the triumph of the “historic movement” that brought him to power and restored the people to the control of their own government. Of course, as he knows, winning a battle, even a crucial one, is not the same as winning the war.\n",
      "On the campaign trail, he emphasized that Americans are governed by “very, very stupid people.” In his Inaugural Address he abandoned all reference to stupidity and indicted their malevolence. But in a very unspecific way: He left the motive behind the ruling class’s bad, selfish policies, and their indifference to the sufferings of the people, unstated. Was it liberalism that made them do it? Greed? He politely didn’t say. Could it have something to do with their pride in transcending the Constitution?\n",
      "In his short, forceful speech, Mr. Trump spoke up for “the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.” He admitted, however, the awful demoralization of many members of the working and middle class — “this American carnage,” he called it, in the speech’s most striking phrase. Nonetheless, he continues to believe in the people, righteous or not, though maybe not as much as he believes in himself.\n",

      "NEW DELHI — The only joy today in watching Donald J. Trump speak as the 45th president of the United States is that, as an Indian, I can redirect words that a Pakistani Urdu poet once spoke to us. \n",
      "In March 2014, as India seemed set to elect a new leader, Fahmida Riaz sat before an Indian audience and recited her poem “Tum Bilkul Hum Jaise Nikle” (“You Turned Out Just Like Us”). She was referring to our soon-to-be prime minister, Narendra Modi, who was running a campaign that skillfully melded the appeal of an outsider (he had once been a tea seller, he claimed) to the established order with the language of Hindu majoritarian politics, tapping in to existing prejudices against India’s Muslim minority.\n",
      "Ms. Riaz spoke to her audience:\n",
      "“You turned out just like us / \n",
      "where were you hidden till now brother / \n",
      "The same stupidity and ignorance / \n",
      "that gripped us for a century / \n",
      "has reached your doors today”\n",
      "When I heard Mr. Trump’s speech today in New Delhi, it was difficult to escape the echo of what we have already witnessed in India. In his inaugural speech, Mr. Modi talked of pulling the poor of India out of poverty. Many pundits, quick to look for hope where there was none, said that Mr. Modi’s speech reflected a new inclusiveness after the hatred of the campaign. \n",

      "For his opponents within the Democratic Party, it was remarkable for his commitment, standing just feet away from former President Obama, to scrap his political agenda on the foreign and domestic scene. Mr. Trump all but called the former president a total failure, and promised a solution that upends the norms of Washington.\n",
      "For his opponents within the Republican Party, it was remarkable for serving notice that he does not view them as much better. He berated both parties for being venal and corrupt, and announced an agenda on trade and foreign policy starkly different from what the Ronald Reagan coalition sought for 40 years. In particular, his pronouncements on foreign policy cut sharply against the views of American exceptionalism favored by George W. Bush.\n",
      "For his critics in the media, it was remarkable for utterly breaking with every conventional expectation for an inaugural that speaks to a false sense of unity. Instead, Mr. Trump doubled down on the idea that he is the champion uniting patriotic Americans against a corrupt bipartisan elite that has served them poorly for 16 years. \n",
      "This was a speech for those who support him, and it immensely satisfied supporters I spoke with on the mall.

      "What we got, coinciding with the first rain drops falling while Trump spoke to the nation he now leads, was a clenched fist — his own salute of nationalism and defiance, borrowed from political causes rooted in far different passions. He raised the fist while taking his place at the Capitol steps, and again at the close of a dark, soulless speech introducing himself as the leader of the free world.  \n",
      "We might be able to ignore the fist had he mentioned liberty, the Constitution, equality for all, some joy note to American values. We might be able to give him a wider berth, an open heart, had he quoted Washington, from that humble first inaugural in 1789, or Lincoln, with his call to our better angels, or Kennedy’s plea for a patriotism of selflessness.\n",

      "The populist tone, from a man who lost the popular vote — “the day the people became the rulers of this nation again” — would be welcome, had not Trump brought to Washington a cabinet of the very wealthy and the very elite, a predators’ ball. Included among them is a Treasury nominee whose bank foreclosed on some of those Trump proclaims to speak for. And a labor pick who doesn’t believe fast food workers should earn a living wage. \n",
      "The nationalist tone — “buy American, and hire American” — would also be welcome had not Trump done the opposite to enrich himself over the years, from using Chinese steel in his hotels in Las Vegas to employing foreign workers for his properties in Florida. \n",
      "The chorus of nationalism in the speech — “From this day forward, it’s going to only be America first. America first” — might even be appealing, had it not those ugly echoes of history. Trump is no doubt ignorant that a similar phrase was used by isolationist, anti-Semitic Americans who aimed to appease Adolf Hitler as it was just becoming clear how much of a monster he would be. \n",
      "Take Trump, as I’ve said before, not at his word, but for his actions. What we saw on Inauguration Day of the 45th president was the truest sign of how he will rule: not by extending an open hand, but by raising a clenched fist.\n",

On his return from his first visit to Washington, he proclaimed “Pakistan First.” He was such a great buddy of President George W. Bush that he got the latter to endorse his book on television.

Mr. Trump promised to return power to the people, but he didn’t talk much about their role in the process. Instead, it indicates that the government will be the vehicle of popular sentiment — placing power with the people.\n",
      "But I leave the event with some hope about American democracy. In the section I was in, many people clapped when Mr. Trump talked about the Obamas and the transition. The protests I saw this morning were peaceful and substantive. This doesn’t mean that democracy is always easy or always feels good. In fact, the truth is probably the opposite: Democracy is hard work and filled with conflict.\n",

      "Many participants to the World Economic Forum had already left this Swiss Alpine resort by the time President Donald J. Trump spoke. Some of those still here, oblivious to the “revolution” in Washington,  chose to attend the closing performance in the Congress Hall, given by an Afghan women’s orchestra joined by young Swiss musicians.

      "One of the most celebrated moments of the First World War took place on Christmas morning 1914, along the Western Front. Thousands of British and German troops, without prompting, climbed out of the trenches and met in no-man’s land. Gathered together on frozen ground, the men sang carols well into the night; they traded chocolate and cigarettes and kicked soccer balls. “It was a short peace,” a Scottish infantryman recalled, “in a terrible war.”  \n",
      "Inauguration Day, historically, has been a little like that: a pause, a brief truce, “an interlude of national reunion,” as the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. put it. After a divisive election, the inaugural ceremony — and its centerpiece, the presidential address — is meant to reaffirm our common identity as Americans, before we resume fighting about what exactly that means. \n",
      "Donald J. Trump added his voice to history’s chorus today, and it was shrill and discordant. If any new president had a need to repair the breach, it was Mr. Trump — who was roundly, even vehemently, rejected by some 73 million voters, about 10 million more than the number that supported him. “We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny,” Mr. Trump proclaimed, one of a number of anodyne, unobjectionable phrases urging unity and “solidarity.” Yet he refused — pointedly — even to acknowledge his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. \n",
      "Beyond the boilerplate, Mr. Trump’s Inaugural Address was mostly a buttoned-up version of his campaign stump speech, targeting the same audience of “forgotten men and women” who share his disgust for what he called a “small group in our nation’s capital.” He inflamed, again, these Americans’ sense of betrayal by the “establishment” and painted, again, his dark, counterfactual picture of “American carnage.” \n",
      "A dark cloud hangs over this inauguration that no oratory could possibly dispel. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to take office in a climate of foreboding: After the election of 1800, Federalists expected that Jefferson would abandon the Constitution and align the United States with France; in 1933, conservatives charged that F.D.R. was a homegrown Hitler. \n",
      "But none of Mr. Trump’s 44 predecessors offered more reason than we have today to fear for the survival of democracy in America. Mr. Trump’s infatuation with foreign strongmen, including the one who intervened in the election on his behalf; his brazen self-dealing and self-justification; his intolerance for difference and dissent; his appeals to racism and resentment; the contempt he has shown, consistently, for the rule of law, the freedom of the press, the system of checks and balances, the very notion of equal rights — all this puts the American experiment in peril. \n",
      "Mr. Trump’s compulsive dishonesty makes it foolish to put faith in anything he says, and that includes the most important words he uttered today: that he will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Our era of ill feeling found its standard-bearer today. \n",

It is a tradition for new presidents to open their arms to the rest of the world: to assert America’s role as the strongest supporter, if not the automatic guarantor, of freedom around the world.

      "Grasping at historical straws, President Donald J. Trump and his supporters have likened him, absurdly, to Andrew Jackson. The analogy is false in every detail. \n",
      "Jackson came to the presidency with an enormous popular mandate; Mr. Trump didn’t even win the popular vote. Jackson was defeated in 1824 amid charges that corruption and untoward interference had turned the election; Mr. Trump won amid charges of corruption and interference. Jackson devoted his presidency to warring against the system that made Mr. Trump his fortune, the swindler capitalism that defrauds humble and honest Americans. \n",
      "Jackson thundered against the rich and powerful who thwarted democracy; Mr. Trump thunders against illegal immigrants. Jackson and his party came to power thanks to a steady expansion of the citizenry and the democratic vote; Mr. Trump’s party seeks to narrow the citizenry through unsubtle voter suppression. Jackson vindicated the federal government and crushed those like John C. Calhoun who sought to demonize it; Mr. Trump demonizes the federal government — more Calhoun than Old Hickory. \n",
      "Jackson bore on his skull deep scars from the wounds he suffered as a boy soldier in the Revolution, and, badly outnumbered, he defeated the British at New Orleans. For the rest of his life, he remained resolute that United States should stand as a bulwark against foreign monarchies and tyrannies.  Mr. Trump the draft dodger seeks accord with the murderous President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. \n",
      "Historians describe Jackson as a fearless and sometimes fearsome populist who rode a groundswell of public outrage. Mr. Trump has tried to come across the same way, promising, in his Inaugural Address, to return the government to the people. But plenty of politicians over the years have tried the same gambit. Mr. Trump’s phony populism, the latest in a long line of phony populisms, has been his greatest con. It has nothing to do with Andrew Jackson or Jacksonian Democracy, or any kind of democracy at all.\n",

      "“The time for empty talk is over,” our new president said near the end of his relatively brief Inaugural Address. And if he actually makes good on that promise, if the speech wasn’t just talk but a blueprint for effective presidential action, then we just watched an epochal moment: the last rites of Reaganite conservatism, and the birth of a populist and nationalist new right.\n",
      "The speech was, as predicted, “Jacksonian” — populist, combative, anti-Washington, thick with promises to eradicate America’s enemies and favor the forgotten man over globalist elites. But if it was anti-Washington, it was not remotely anti-government: Just as he did on the campaign trail, Trump eschewed the rhetoric of liberty in favor of expansive promises of “protection” and rhapsodic paeans to infrastructure spending. \n",
      "At its darkest, this sort of protective politics veers toward fascism; at its best (and the new president’s rhetoric did try to reach in that direction) it points toward a pan-ethnic nationalism, a \n",
      "right-wing politics of solidarity\n",
      ". But in neither case is it compatible with the limited-government catechism and the Republican politics that pushes for free trade deals and fights against Medicaid expansions.\n",
      "Thus, the great ideological questions of the Trump era: Will his rhetoric actually define the policy that gets made in the halls of Congress, where a more Reaganite conservatism still theoretically holds sway? Or will his words be a Buchananite patina on an agenda mostly written by supply-siders and Goldman Sachs appointees? Or will the conflict between the two tendencies simply make his administration less epochal than incoherent, less transformative than simply ineffective?\n",

      " cited the political scientist Stephen Skowronek’s theory of “disjunctive” presidents who straddle transitions between old orders and emerging ones. One such president was Jimmy Carter, who tried to maintain the creaking New Deal coalition while also grasping at a new vision for liberal governance. He failed because his party simply couldn’t accommodate the tension, and he himself couldn’t effectively blend the old and new.\n",
      "Right now Trump looks like he might be similarly disjunctive. Like Mr. Carter with the ’70s-era Democrats, he has grasped — correctly — that Republican politics desperately needs to be reinvented. But his populist-nationalist vision has seemed too racially and culturally exclusive to win him majority support, and it’s layered atop a party that still mostly believes in the “populism” of cutting the estate tax.\n",
      "Combine those brute political facts with Trump’s implausibly expansive promises, and a Carter scenario — gridlock, disappointment, collapse — seems like the most plausible way to bet. But on the evidence of this speech, Trump has no intention of playing it safe: He will either remake conservatism in his image, or see his presidency fail in the attempt.\n",

President Trump represents Mexico’s biggest foreign policy challenge in recent history, with his proposed triple whammy of import tariffs, mass deportations and a border wall that Mexico has to pay for.

Police stood around in their bright yellow vests, smiling and posing for selfies with tourists. Two women held an American flag. I talked to one of them. Mary Lou, from Pennsylvania, told me she had nothing but sympathies for migrants and refugees, as she had spent half of her life in London. She was “apprehensive” about Trump’s program and was “in constant dialogue” with her elected representative in Pennsylvania.\n",
      "At 8:40 or so, the banner was dropped at the Westminster Bridge, while nine other bridges, and more than 200 around the world, offered similar messages of resistance to Trumpian malice. Wearing a shirt saying “I am an immigrant,” the Big Ben behind her back, Zrinka spoke to a Sky TV camera about the necessity of resistance to hate and fear, lies and division. It was the first day of the Trumpian era, with many more to come, all of them featuring struggle, all over the world.\n",

At several inauguration entrance checkpoints, different groups of protesters are locked down. “We have nothing to lose but our chains!” chant the Black Lives Matter protesters, literally using chains to shut down an entrance. A massive banner proclaims, “The Future is Feminist!” At another corner, rainbow-clad protesters break out into a spontaneous dance party. \n",
      "This morning, though, I’m thinking of Luciano Balbuena, a grandfather and a retail janitor in Minneapolis, who cleans Home Depot stores for $9.50 an hour and whose only raise came when the state minimum increased. Mr. Balbuena is on strike today with many other janitors in the Twin Cities. \n",
      "“We are trying to put a stop to the poverty wages,” Mr. Balbuena told me yesterday. “Donald Trump, he supports these low wages and he has said that he doesn’t think workers deserve better wages.”\n",
      "And I’m thinking of Richard Robinson, also a grandfather. Mr. Robinson, a veteran and former truck driver, now lives on Social Security. I met him in the rain on Tuesday standing outside the Goldman Sachs building in New York. He had come all the way from Utah to join a protest of the bank’s influence in the incoming Trump administration. \n",
      "Mr. Robinson voted for Mr. Trump, he told me, “on the assumption that he was going to keep a promise and drain the swamp, not fill it deeper.” Now, he’s decided those promises were smoke and mirrors. Mr. Robinson and dozens of others spent the week sleeping on the damp sidewalk. \n",
      "Around the country, today and tomorrow, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to protest this administration. Many, like Mr. Balbuena, were targets of the campaign from the start: Latino workers blamed for the lack of jobs for Americans, queer and transgender people threatened with legalized discrimination, women who see “Grab them by the pussy” echoed in the reported plans to cuts to grant programs for victims of domestic violence.\n",
      "But with people like Mr. Robinson already joining the protests, something else is happening. As Americans have lost faith in their elected officials, they have also proved willing to challenge politicians and take power into their own hands. The resistance in the days to come will set the tone for the Trump administration. \n",

      "For the next four years, Donald J. Trump will be America’s president, but what effect his presidency will have on the country will depend largely on what happens not in the White House but 16 blocks away where, constitutionally, much of the nation’s true power rests.  \n",
      "Because Mr. Trump is so erratic and so prone to acting upon impulse rather than information, the four most important people in America today — at least the four upon whose judgment and character we must now rely — are the ones who hold the leadership positions in the House and Senate. \n",
      "What America becomes in the years ahead will depend largely on how seriously Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer view their roles — not as heads of their parties, not as presidential water-bearers or knee-jerk adversaries, but as those charged with the awesome responsibilities imposed on Congress by the Constitution. \n",
      "I am not confident.  \n",
      "Forty years ago I stood on the House floor and took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. I was a newly elected Republican; most of those who stood with me were Democrats. But the words we spoke promised allegiance to one thing only: our country, not a president and not a political party.\n",
      "In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi became the first woman elected House speaker, I commended her on becoming the most powerful member of both Congress and her party, but also made a request:  “Don’t let Congress become irrelevant on your watch.” In response, and presumably in agreement, she gave me a small lapel pin with the simple inscription “Article 1,” citing the constitutional enshrinement of Congress as the lead institution of the federal government. \n",
      "In the years that followed, the times when members of Congress acted independently of party or president were unfortunately few. Republicans followed the lead of Republican presidents or swore to block any significant proposal by a Democratic president.  Democrats did the same. Presidents set the agenda, parties demanded loyalty. \n",
      "Like Barack Obama and the other men in the long line of presidents, Mr. Trump can spend only what Congress gives him to spend; he can enforce laws only if Congress creates them; his executive orders can be challenged by  congressional action. Even in foreign policy, his authority is largely subject to either congressional approval or silence. Yet for years, under Congresses led by both parties, the legislative branch has ceded its authority to the presidency by submission or inaction.  \n",
      "With Mr. Trump in the White House, that would be a dangerous path to follow. Congress must assert its role as the Article 1 branch of government. Failure to do so may well pose a danger greater than any posed by any foreign rival.   \n",

The concert featured Toby Keith, Three Doors Down –  with no lines for the portable toilets and large swaths of muddy, unoccupied National Mall.

      "In the run-up to the election — when the polls showed Donald Trump with virtually no chance of winning — more than 120 brave souls with varying amounts of government experience in national security signed one or both public letters denouncing Mr. Trump. The organizer of one of the letters, published in \n",
      "The Times\n",
      ", said then “that among the signatories ‘some will vote for’ Mrs. Clinton, and ‘some will not vote, but all agree Trump is not qualified and would be dangerous.’”\n",
      "Not qualified and dangerous. Yet this week, in a \n",
      "Washington Post article\n",
      ", several of these “Never Trumpers” expressed surprise and hurt that they might be “blacklisted” from serving in the administration, or even offering their wisdom. It is no wonder that many of the Americans who voted for Mr. Trump have said that they did so because of the ego-driven, mealy-mouthed hypocrisy that is rampant in Washington insider circles.\n",
      "Indeed, one former “Never Trumper” went so far as to meet with the president-elect and told him she was “privileged and humbled” to be allowed to speak with him, given the fact that she had signed one of the letters calling him “fundamentally dishonest” and unfit for the office of the presidency. She noted, in particular, his “maturity and graciousness.”\n",

In the interests of our country, is it wrong to step up and offer one’s knowledge and expertise to help this president succeed? Particularly in the realm of intelligence and national security, don’t we all need him to succeed?\n",
      "No, we do not want Donald Trump to succeed. We want our country and its citizens to be safe, healthy, prosperous, happy and respected around the world. But it is false logic to conclude that any of that will happen if the Republican elite enable or normalize Mr. Trump in any way, particularly by being his sycophants. There is not one national security policy tweeted or bellowed by Mr. Trump that, if put in place, will help this country. His “proposals” reveal his utter lack of knowledge and understanding of the underpinnings and current status of United States foreign policy, past or present, and his derision of the intelligence community makes clear that he is uninterested in learning what is actually happening around the globe that affects American interests, or places us at risk. After all, he often reminds us that the internet is full of information upon which he can, and will, rely.\n",
      "World history is full of examples of the intelligentsia and permanent governing class offering their services in aid of a strongman who has bullied his way into power. Helping such a man wield and hold on to power has never ended well in the past, and it will not do so now. And if anyone thinks that they are so special that they can change him, persuade him, if only they could work from the inside, please, get real.\n",
      "Job seekers, we hear you say that you need to go in to “save lives.” Do not be blinded by your view of your own amazingness. All you are doing by groveling at the feet of the brute is to prop him up, reinforce his belief in the rightness of his whim of the day. Make no mistake, if Mr. Trump’s “agenda” is successful more, not fewer, Americans and innocents around the world will suffer or die, and none of us will be safer. Do not be part of that.\n",

      "Growing up in Manhattan, the American-born child of immigrants from Hong Kong, I was embarrassed by my family’s strange holidays. I never learned to speak the language, or even use chopsticks. Disney’s “Mulan” felt like a caricature of every stereotype I was teased about in school. When “Fresh Off the Boat” aired on television, it seemed that people like me were the butt of a nationally understood joke — especially when Chinese people were portrayed by Korean actors.\n",
      "I dreaded answering “Where are you from?” When I told an elementary schoolteacher “New York,” she shook her head and asked, “But where are you really from?” As an adult, I cringed when a classmate asked, “What kind of Asian are you?” — or worse, presumed to guess. On a date two years ago, the blond lacrosse player I met from OkCupid said between bites of sushi: “You’re Korean, right? I’m really good at telling Orientals apart.” I was horrified at being fetishized for my race — especially one I didn’t identify with. I just wanted to be American.\n",
      "It took a trip to Asia — and Donald Trump — to help me embrace my identity. \n",
      "After resigning from my Wall Street analyst job because of a chronic wrist injury, I took a solo trip to Asia and went everywhere but China. I didn’t want to be around people who looked like me. And indeed, people often treated me like an outsider. In Penang, Malaysia, a smiling woman brought me a bowl of hokkien mee with hot sauce on the side instead of mixed in — a practice reserved for Caucasians. While surfing in Indonesia, a dark-skinned aboriginal laughed at my thin “city people” arms. “You paddle like chicken,” he said, before showing me a better way to propel. \n",
      "In America, I was viewed as Asian. In Asia, I was viewed as American. I had feared being boxed in by what others thought I was. But belonging is personal, fluid and multicultural. I had clung to being an American as my one immutable identity, not realizing that who I was could not be diluted. Being Asian did not make me less American.\n",
      "Which brings me to Mr. Trump. Sitting on a stool at my mother’s house in Brooklyn during one of the presidential debates, I watched him accuse China of using the United States as a piggy bank and of inventing climate change. Though I had spent my life distancing myself from Asia, his xenophobia made me feel personally rejected.\n",

      "They and others have not wavered in their prolific critiques of Mr. Trump’s conduct and approach to government.\n",
      "Their moral clarity, untainted by the Washington instinct to keep open the doors of “access,” has been entirely admirable. Many liberals and Democrats have been at least as clearheaded about Trump’s unsuitability to serve, but it can be hard to separate our fears from ordinary political disputes about, for example, Obamacare. But the conservatives and libertarians who hold tight to their objections to the shattering of democratic norms and constitutional practices by Mr. Trump occupy a different position and can be heard by audiences who are more likely to favor some of Mr. Trump’s or Representative Paul Ryan’s policies.\n",
      "If their voices don’t waver and Mr. Trump continues along a reckless path, these conservatives, joined by elected officials and grass-roots leaders, may form the basis of a new coalition with liberals — agreeing to disagree on many issues, but sharing a commitment to civil liberties and democratic norms.\n",
      "It may even evolve into the centrist political alignment that pundits have dreamed of since at least the mid-1990s, often calling for figures like Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, to run for national office, on a platform of deficit reduction.\n",
      "The new alliance can seek not to restore the political practices of the past but, by challenging Mr. Trump, to develop a new set of norms that can make citizens feel they’ve been heard, in Washington and locally. That would include objecting not only to Mr. Trump’s open conflicts of interest but also, for example, to tactics such as “repeal and delay” of the Affordable Care Act, because it avoids putting basic choices about policy before legislators and the public.\n",
      "When the threat to constitutional norms posed by Mr. Trump has passed — perhaps because he himself adapts to the constitutional constraints of the presidency — we can return to disagreements about taxation or the role of government in providing a safety net. But perhaps we’ll approach those fights with a newfound appreciation of the dangers of treating these policy differences as if they were existential choices, worthy of victory at any cost, because that is the form of politics that led to the reign of Donald J. Trump.\n",
      "The new centrist alliance has taken first root among elites — journalists and political figures who had been successful in the existing system. This new community of voices willing to challenge Mr. Trump and stand up for constitutional norms might be the most important new coalition of the dangerous era ahead.\n",
