We were permitted to snap photos for most of the lunch (Jake put a ton on Twitter <a disabled=\"disabled\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2jAvyfj\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2jAvyfj</a>).</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>-- THE INVITED GUESTS</b> were not only lawmakers, but, as the WaPo’s top congressional reporter Paul Kane pointed out on Twitter, the lunch also included top donors like Sheldon Adelson for the first time in his memory. They all sipped wine and chatted in a friendly manner that belied the blow-up-Washington rhetoric that Trump used in his address.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>-- MITCH MCCONNELL </b>swapped seats with <b>SEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO.)</b>, the chairman of the inaugural committee, so he could sit next to Donald Trump. McConnell and Trump spoke for a long period of time -- and if you know McConnell, he doesn’t talk to anyone for that long unless he has something to say. The senator was doing a lot of the talking, and he’s not much for small talk. This was a one-on-one chat, with even Mike Pence laying back. McConnell and Trump were both talking with their hands, with McConnell at one point making a “T” with his two hands, appearing to illustrate a collision. McConnell is the ultimate Capitol operator. He’ll be able to tell Trump what is -- and, more importantly, what isn’t -- possible. Plus, he doesn’t have the scar tissue with Trump that Ryan has.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>-- CHUCK SCHUMER</b> spoke with <b>TRUMP</b> for a while, too. The format was a lot less formal. Melania Trump was seated next to the president, and Abby Blunt -- Sen. Blunt’s wife, and a top lobbyist for Kraft Heinz Company -- was in the middle of the chat as well. It seemed like a friendly conversation from afar.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>-- ROY BLUNT</b>, who chaired the inauguration, worked the room judiciously on his own, but also made sure to introduce Trump to people that he should know. One of the most notable introductions he made was Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>-- </b>It’s becoming clear how <b>TRUMP </b>sees <b>PAUL RYAN. </b>He quipped at a ceremony this week that Ryan was probably “out writing legislation. He’s got so much legislation to write. He never had it so good. He’s actually got somebody that’s gonna sign it.” That’s actually not a bad read. Ryan is the legislator of this gang. He was seated at the end of the table, next to Karen Pence, the second lady.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>-- IT WAS ALSO FASCINATING</b> to see which lawmakers took it upon themselves to go up to Trump. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, got words in with Trump. Rep. John Larson, a gregarious Democrat from Connecticut, also approached the front table to chat with him. <b>DAVID SHULKIN</b>, the VA nominee, seemed friendly not only with Trump, but also with Schumer.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>-- KEVIN MCCARTHY </b>will be a key figure for Trump. Trump said this week that McCarthy frequently called the New Yorker when he was feuding with Paul Ryan. Think of McCarthy as the insider -- the pal in the House. According to people close to both men, Trump enjoys McCarthy and his phone calls. At the lunch, he was seated next to Ivanka and a few seats away from Jared.<br/></p>,\n",

Vincent Viola, nominated to be Army secretary, punched a man in the face at a horse race last summer. The ex-wife of Andrew Puzder, the labor secretary nominee, once appeared incognito on ‘Oprah’ to raise domestic abuse allegations, which Puzder has denied. Betsy DeVos, Trump’s choice for education secretary, struggled to demonstrate a basic comprehension of department policy and basic education terms during her hearing this week. Two nominees didn’t pay taxes on their household employees. This string of startling revelations over the past two weeks caught senior members of Trump’s staff by surprise, and they didn’t know some of the potential for problems before Senate confirmation hearings began.” <a disabled=\"disabled\" href=\"http://politi.co/2kd34eG\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">http://politi.co/2kd34eG</a></p>,\n",

      "Good Saturday morning. More than 200,000 people are descending on Washington this morning to participate in the Women’s March. The effort, which includes six “sister marches” across the country, is featuring more than 50 speakers, including Gloria Steinem, in downtown D.C. before walking 2 miles along the National Mall to The Ellipse. Organizers were still looking for additional marshals Friday afternoon to help shepherd the larger than expected number of attendees.\n",

      "UNDERSTANDING WHAT TRUMP SIGNED LAST NIGHT -- “Trump signs sweeping order that could gut Obamacare,” by Jen Haberkorn and Nolan McCaskill: “The order changes nothing immediately and doesn't spell out exactly what Trump would like his government to do. But it sends a strong symbolic message to his supporters, while offering some clues to his direction. Federal agencies could use the order to stop enforcing the individual mandate, which has been the most contentious piece of the law -- a move that could throw the individual insurance market into an almost immediate spiral.” \n",
      "-- “White House orders ‘immediate regulatory freeze,’” by Andrew Restuccia and Nick Juliano: “President Donald Trump took his first steps Friday night toward what he has promised will be a wide-ranging assault on Barack Obama’s regulatory agenda, a crusade eventually aimed at erasing Obamacare and landmark climate change regulations. Trump’s initial action -- ordering a freeze on all pending regulations until his administration can review them -- would have a more modest impact: It could throttle almost-completed rules aimed at expanding overtime pay, tightening pipeline safety, protecting imperiled bumblebees and imposing stricter safeguards on rail shipments of flammable crude oil, among other topics.” \n",

The unorthodox politician and the Republican-controlled Congress are charting a newly conservative course for the nation, vowing to reverse the work of the departing Barack Obama.”\n",
      "FROM 1600 PENNSYLVANIA -- @realDonaldTrump at 6:53 a.m.: “A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!”\n",
      "THE JUICE -- WHAT WE’VE LEARNED --THE MOST INTERESTING THING about yesterday was not the speech, parade or protests. It was the inaugural lunch in the Capitol, where Donald Trump mingled and back-slapped with the long-time D.C. politicians he dumped all over on the National Mall. THE SCENE: Reporters were allowed to observe the lunch from a balcony above Statuary Hall. We were permitted to snap photos for most of the lunch (Jake put a ton on Twitter ).\n",
      "-- THE INVITED GUESTS were not only lawmakers, but, as the WaPo’s top congressional reporter Paul Kane pointed out on Twitter, the lunch also included top donors like Sheldon Adelson for the first time in his memory. They all sipped wine and chatted in a friendly manner that belied the blow-up-Washington rhetoric that Trump used in his address.\n",
      "-- MITCH MCCONNELL swapped seats with SEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO.), the chairman of the inaugural committee, so he could sit next to Donald Trump. McConnell and Trump spoke for a long period of time -- and if you know McConnell, he doesn’t talk to anyone for that long unless he has something to say. The senator was doing a lot of the talking, and he’s not much for small talk. This was a one-on-one chat, with even Mike Pence laying back. McConnell and Trump were both talking with their hands, with McConnell at one point making a “T” with his two hands, appearing to illustrate a collision. McConnell is the ultimate Capitol operator. He’ll be able to tell Trump what is -- and, more importantly, what isn’t -- possible. Plus, he doesn’t have the scar tissue with Trump that Ryan has.\n",
      "-- CHUCK SCHUMER spoke with TRUMP for a while, too. The format was a lot less formal. Melania Trump was seated next to the president, and Abby Blunt -- Sen. Blunt’s wife, and a top lobbyist for Kraft Heinz Company -- was in the middle of the chat as well. It seemed like a friendly conversation from afar.\n",
      "-- ROY BLUNT, who chaired the inauguration, worked the room judiciously on his own, but also made sure to introduce Trump to people that he should know. One of the most notable introductions he made was Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat.\n",
      "-- It’s becoming clear how TRUMP sees PAUL RYAN. He quipped at a ceremony this week that Ryan was probably “out writing legislation. He’s got so much legislation to write. He never had it so good. He’s actually got somebody that’s gonna sign it.” That’s actually not a bad read. Ryan is the legislator of this gang. He was seated at the end of the table, next to Karen Pence, the second lady.\n",
      "-- IT WAS ALSO FASCINATING to see which lawmakers took it upon themselves to go up to Trump. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, got words in with Trump. Rep. John Larson, a gregarious Democrat from Connecticut, also approached the front table to chat with him. DAVID SHULKIN, the VA nominee, seemed friendly not only with Trump, but also with Schumer.\n",
      "-- KEVIN MCCARTHY will be a key figure for Trump. Trump said this week that McCarthy frequently called the New Yorker when he was feuding with Paul Ryan. Think of McCarthy as the insider -- the pal in the House. According to people close to both men, Trump enjoys McCarthy and his phone calls. At the lunch, he was seated next to Ivanka and a few seats away from Jared.\n",

      "THE NEXT FOUR YEARS? -- “Rough first day for press in Trump’s White House,” by Sarah Wheaton: “The pomp and circumstance ended in pandemonium in the White House briefing room. President Donald Trump’s staff teased the press all afternoon on Friday about whether Trump would sign executive orders. ‘A possibility,’ said Press Secretary Sean Spicer. ‘Potentially,’ said strategic communications director Hope Hicks. ‘Don’t start drinking yet,’ said deputy Communications director Raj Shah. The back-and-forth ended with Trump signing an executive order allowing federal agencies to disregard provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n",
      "“In the hours leading up to Trump's signing, Spicer emerged repeatedly, without warning, to address the press in the briefing room, prompting reporters to run through the corridor and push each other out of the way. He announced, at first, that Trump would sign two executive orders. Then he announced there’d be three actions – and in the end, only one of them was actually an executive order. Though he promised a full readout of the executive order, a vague directive to agencies to ‘ease the burden’ of Obamacare before it’s repealed, Spicer ultimately delivered a 30-second statement that didn’t mention the order, and tweeted to confirm it had been signed.” \n",
      "THE LOYAL OPPOSITION -- “An Anti-Corporate Investigative Reporter Will Lead Left’s ‘Answer’ To Breitbart: Hillary Clinton fundraiser David Brock has hired David Sirota, a critic of big money ties to both parties.” by BuzzFeed’s Paul McLeod: “True Blue Media, pitching itself as the left’s answer to Breitbart, has picked an investigative reporter critical of Republicans and Wall Street Democrats alike as its new CEO. David Sirota is leaving his role as senior investigations editor at the International Business Times to lead True Blue, which currently operates as ShareBlue and was part of a network of liberal outlets supporting Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign.” \n",

      "MICHAEL GRUNWALD in Politico, “From Obama to Trump: No Ordinary Lurch: The ceremony might have looked smooth, but it’s hard to imagine a more abrupt change in the American presidency”: “Trump was Trump, even though he had just become President Trump. He is no ordinary politician, and his inaugural address—a pugilistic, nationalistic, campaign-style screed that made America sound like an unbearable dystopia—was a harsh reminder, if one were needed, that this was no ordinary transfer of power. ... It’s an abrupt shift not only from a Democratic technocrat who pursued progressive policies to a Republican billionaire who has vowed to undo them, but from no-drama to melodrama, from cerebral and methodical to impulsive and chaotic, from the pedantic intellectual who loathes cable news and quoted V.S. Naipaul in an exit interview with the New York Times book critic to the brand-savvy entrepreneur and reality-TV host who incessantly watches cable news and does not seem to read books at all.” \n",
      "FACT CHECK -- NYT A21, “Trump’s Grim View of the Economy Ignores Most Americans’ Reality,” by Binyamin Appelbaum: “The dismal picture of the American economy President Donald J. Trump painted in his Inaugural Address on Friday is at odds with the economic reality of most Americans. Mr. Trump described a nation depleted, despairing and in decline. ... In fact, the United States is in the midst of one of the longest sustained economic expansions in the nation’s history. The stock market has climbed to record heights; middle-class incomes are increasing after years of stagnation; and corporations are recording enormous profits. Some measures of consumer confidence show that optimism about the economic outlook, and job and income prospects have climbed to the highest levels in more than a decade.” \n",
      "SNEAK PEAK -- KELLYANNE CONWAY on NBC’s “Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist”: When asked if President-elect Trump will answer every criticism, like SNL and Meryl Streep, Conway says, “He doesn’t answer every criticism, believe me” and he will “possibly engage pop culture but again, he rarely draws first blood.” “Why was it okay for President Obama -- everybody swooned and thought it was a wonderful idea that he would engage pop culture on his own terms, and if Donald Trump does it a little bit differently through his social media platforms everybody feigns shock and dismay?” \n",
      "THE CABINET -- “Weak vetting led to Cabinet confirmation surprises,” by Josh Dawsey and Eli Stokols: “Steve Mnuchin, Donald Trump’s pick to be treasury Secretary, failed to list $100 million in assets on his federal disclosure forms. Vincent Viola, nominated to be Army secretary, punched a man in the face at a horse race last summer. The ex-wife of Andrew Puzder, the labor secretary nominee, once appeared incognito on ‘Oprah’ to raise domestic abuse allegations, which Puzder has denied. Betsy DeVos, Trump’s choice for education secretary, struggled to demonstrate a basic comprehension of department policy and basic education terms during her hearing this week. Two nominees didn’t pay taxes on their household employees. This string of startling revelations over the past two weeks caught senior members of Trump’s staff by surprise, and they didn’t know some of the potential for problems before Senate confirmation hearings began.” \n",
      "THE NEW ADMINISTRATION -- “With Trump in Charge, Climate Change References Purged From Website,” by NYT’s Coral Davenport: “Within moments of the inauguration of President Trump, the official White House website on Friday deleted nearly all mentions of climate change. The one exception: Mr. Trump’s vow to eliminate the Obama administration’s climate change policies, which previously had a prominent and detailed web page on whitehouse.gov.” \n",
      "-- “Republicans delay DeVos committee vote by a week,” by Michael Stratford: “Sen. Lamar Alexander, chair of the Senate education committee, has delayed by a week a planned committee vote on Betsy DeVos, President Donald Trump’s nominee for Education secretary. The vote, which was originally slated for this Tuesday, has been rescheduled until Jan. 31, Alexander announced Friday evening. The delay comes as Democrats have argued that they haven’t had enough time to examine DeVos’ complicated financial holdings or ask her questions.” \n",
